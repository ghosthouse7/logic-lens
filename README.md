 What is LogicLens?

**LogicLens** is an intelligent developer assistant built for the **AI Agents Assemble Hackathon**. It solves the biggest problem for students and junior developers: **Understanding Spaghetti Code.**

Instead of staring at complex logic, LogicLens instantly converts code into interactive **Flowcharts**, analyzes **Time/Space Complexity**, and uses an Autonomous AI Agent to **Auto-Fix** inefficient algorithms.

Key Features

1. Visual Logic Engine
- Parses Python, JavaScript, C++, and Java.
- Generates **Mermaid.js** flowcharts in real-time.
- **Why it matters:** Visualize recursion and nested loops instantly without drawing a single line.

2.The "Auto-Fix" Agent (Tank Backend)
- Powered by **Groq (Llama 3.3)** for sub-second inference.
- Detects inefficiencies (e.g., Bubble Sort, Redundant Loops).
- **One-Click Optimization:** Automatically rewrites code to be production-ready.

3.Multi-Persona Roaster
- Learning shouldn't be boring. Get code reviews in:
    - **Strict Dada (Bengali Senior Dev)** 
    - **GenZ Slang** 💀
    - **Pirate Speak** 🏴‍☠️
    - **Hindi Roaster** 🇮🇳

4.📊 Algorithmic Profiler
- Real-time Big O notation analysis.
- Detailed Time Complexity & Space Complexity breakdown.

 How to Run Locally

Want to test the logic yourself?

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone [https://github.com/ghosthouse7/logic-lens.git](https://github.com/ghosthouse7/logic-lens.git)

# 2. Navigate to directory
cd logic-lens

# 3. Install dependencies
npm install

# 4. Setup Environment Variables
# Create a .env file and add your Groq API Key
echo "VITE_GROQ_API_KEY=your_key_here" > .env

# 5. Start the engine
npm run dev
```
